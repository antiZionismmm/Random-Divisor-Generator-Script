## Random Divisor Generator

This script is a simple batch file written in the Windows command prompt language (CMD). It allows you to generate a list of random divisors for a given number.

### Usage

1. Run the script by double-clicking on it or executing it from the command prompt.
2. Enter a number when prompted to provide the input number.
3. Enter the value of `n`, which represents the number of random divisors you want to generate.
4. The script will generate `n` random integers that sum up to the entered number.
5. The divisors will be displayed on the console output, separated by commas.
6. Press any key to close the script.

Please note that this script uses the `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` command to enable delayed variable expansion, which allows for the dynamic updating of variables within loops.

Feel free to customize and modify the script according to your needs. Enjoy!
